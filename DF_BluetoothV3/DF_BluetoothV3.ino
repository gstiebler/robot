 DF-BluetoothV3 Bluetooth module
 
 Intefaces the DF-BluetoothV3 Bluetooth module with most Arduino contollers.
 
 When the DF-Bluetooth is used on Arduino, please make sure you disconnect the 
 DF-Bluetooth module before uploading any code to your Arduino. It wonâ€™t burn 
 your Arduino, but the uploading will fail as the DF-Bluetooth module occupying 
 the TX/RX pins.
